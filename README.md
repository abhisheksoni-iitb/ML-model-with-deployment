# Used car price prediction

## Description 
The dataset is about the price of the used cars based on the certain factors mainly:

* The Company make
* The car model
* The model year
* Condition
* The travelled distance by the car
* Fuel type of the  car
* Volume of the car
* Color of the car
* Transmission type of the car
* Drive unit type of the car
* Segment type of the car

1. The **Model python script** can be found here:  **[ Model](model.py)**
2. The **data exploration** jupyter notebook can be found here **[Notebook](car-price-data-exploration.ipynb)**

I have deployed this model via an application on **Heroku platform**
